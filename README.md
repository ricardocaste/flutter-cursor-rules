In recent years, AI-powered tools have transformed the way we build software. Among these, Cursor has quickly emerged as a favorite among developers - especially those working in large codebases or fast-paced environments. But what makes Cursor special is not only its elegant user interface or its compatibility with multiple models. It's the power of Cursor Rules, a feature that allows you to define how AI should behave when interacting with your code.

# What Is Cursor?
Cursor is an AI-first code editor built on top of VS Code. It integrates deeply with OpenAI's GPT models to enable AI-native workflows directly inside your development environment. You can ask it to write, refactor, or explain code - all in context, and without jumping between tools.
But more than just a wrapper for GPT, Cursor offers powerful AI orchestration, enabling workflows like:
Smart file navigation with AI
Context-aware code generation
Inline agent-like suggestions
Support for .cursorrules to customize AI behavior per project or language

That last point - Cursor Rules - is what really sets it apart.

# What Are Cursor Rules?
Think of Cursor Rules as guardrails for AI in your project. They're YAML or JSON files that live in your repository and tell the AI:
What to prioritize
What patterns or conventions to follow
How to behave in specific coding contexts

This makes the AI not just a generic assistant, but a project-specific expert.
You can define:
File-specific conventions (e.g. architecture patterns)
Preferred libraries
Naming conventions
Code style rules
And even behavioral instructions like "avoid adding dependencies"

By tailoring AI to your team's coding standards, Cursor becomes exponentially more useful and reliable.
